## **About the Website**
----
**ABET Assessment Report Hub** is to automate and facilitate the assessment report process for the engineering department faculty members since the traditional way of creating an assessment report using a word processing application like Microsoft Word is time-consuming and tedious for the members. Other than providing a convenient and fast approach for creating assessment reports, the application also acts as a stronghold for all the data to be stored. With the data being saved the application will also provide the ability to export all students' performance criteria scores from a selected school term or cycle of time so can the data be used for the outcome report or to study the performance of the students within a course.
